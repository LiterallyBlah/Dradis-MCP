# Update a specific vulnerability
This MCP tool allows you to update a specific vulnerability in the current Dradis project. It grabs the set project ID stored in the MCP server and uses it to make the request to Dradis.

## MCP Server Request Syntax

The MCP server accepts requests in the following format:
```json
{
    "action": "updateVulnerability",
    "data": {
        "id": "vulnerability_id",
        "text": "Updated vulnerability content"
    }
}
```

## Dradis API Call
The Dradis API uses a PUT request to `/pro/api/issues/:id` to update an existing issue. Here's an example:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://dradis.example.com/pro/api/issues/45" \
     -H "Authorization: Token token=YOUR_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Dradis-Project-Id: YOUR_PROJECT_ID" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
         "issue": {
             "text": "#[Title]#\r\nUpdated Issue Title\r\n\r\n#[Rating]#\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n#[Description]#\r\nUpdated sample Issue description"
         }
     }'
```

Note: The `text` field should contain the full content of the issue, including field names with the `#[ ]#` syntax. Use `\r\n` for line breaks. The `:id` in the URL should be replaced with the actual ID of the vulnerability you want to update.
